# classificationanalysis

This project completed during training(data science course).

In this project i used pandas for csv reading, numpy for data array and missing value handling, sklearn for classification models like random forest and support vector machine as
 well as training and test data spliting as well as labeling of character data fields as well as making confusion matrix for model result.
 
In this project logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest algorithms are included.

we can also check the accuracy of the model.

we can predict the class of the dependent column of the data(For example yes/no, 1/0 etc.)

dependent column will be only one but independent column will be one or more than one.

Data split in to train data and test data. we can train model by train data and test that model on test data and then find accuracy and then predict the class.

Here i did label encoding because machine learning algorithm in python can decide in a better way on how those numeric labels must be operated and it is important pre-processing
step for the structured data in SUPERVISED LEARNING.
